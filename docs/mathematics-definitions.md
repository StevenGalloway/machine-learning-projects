# Mathematics for Machine Learning

## Statistics

-   **Mean (μ):** average of values.\
-   **Median:** middle value; robust to outliers.\
-   **Mode:** most frequent value.\
-   **Variance (σ²):** spread of data around the mean.\
-   **Standard Deviation (σ):** √variance; typical deviation from mean.\
-   **Percentiles/Quantiles:** values at given ranks (e.g., 90th
    percentile).\
-   **Covariance & Correlation:** measure linear relationships.\
-   **Skewness:** asymmetry of distribution; indicates outliers.

## Probability

-   **Random Variables:** quantities with uncertainty.\
-   **Conditional Probability:** P(A\|B).\
-   **Bayes' Rule:** updates beliefs with evidence.\
-   **Expectation:** average outcome over many trials.\
-   **Independence:** events do not influence each other.\
-   **Common Distributions:** Normal, Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson.

## Linear Algebra

-   **Vectors & Matrices:** core data structures in ML.\
-   **Matrix Multiplication:** composition of linear transformations.\
-   **Dot Product:** similarity measure.\
-   **Norms (L1, L2):** magnitude of vectors; used in regularization.\
-   **Distances:** Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine (similarity).

## Optimization

-   **Derivatives & Gradients:** direction of steepest ascent/descent.\
-   **Gradient Descent:** iterative minimization of loss.\
-   **Learning Rate:** step size; too large → divergence, too small →
    slow.\
-   **Convergence:** reaching a stable minimum.\
-   **Regularization:** L1/L2 to prevent overfitting.
